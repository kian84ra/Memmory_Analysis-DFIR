# What is DFIR?
  Digital Forensics & Incident Response:
    Forensics: Collecting and analyzing digital evidence.
    Incident Response: Containing and mitigating cyber threats.

  Key DFIR Concepts
    Artifacts: Evidence of activity (e.g., registry keys, logs).
    Evidence Preservation:
      Write-protect original evidence.
      Analyze copies to avoid contamination.
    Chain of Custody: Track evidence handling to maintain integrity.
    Order of Volatility: Collect most volatile data first (RAM → Disk).
    Timeline Creation: Chronological reconstruction of events.

# Essential DFIR Tools

Volatility	            Memory forensics (Windows/Linux).	              Cross-platform
KAPE	                  Rapid artifact collection & parsing.	          Windows
Autopsy	                Disk forensics & timeline analysis.	            Cross-platform
Redline	                Live system forensic analysis.	                Windows
Velociraptor	          Endpoint monitoring & response.	                Cross-platform

# Incident Response Process (PICERL/NIST)
  Preparation
    Train teams, deploy tools, establish protocols.
  Identification
    Detect and analyze incidents (memory forensics helps here).
  Containment
    Isolate affected systems (short-term & long-term fixes).
  Eradication
    Remove threats (e.g., malware, attacker access).
  Recovery
    Restore systems to normal operation.
  Lessons Learned
    Document findings, improve defenses

# NIST Equivalent Steps
  Preparation → Same.
  Detection & Analysis → Identification.
  Containment, Eradication, Recovery → Combined.
  Post-Incident Activity → Lessons Learned.

# Memory Forensics is critical for detecting live threats.

# DFIR combines forensics and cybersecurity to respond to incidents.

# Tools like Volatility & KAPE automate evidence collection.

#Follow PICERL/NIST for structured incident response.
